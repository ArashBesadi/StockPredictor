# StockPredictorModel
The StockPredictorModel is an algorithm written in Scala to predict the stock market direction using logistic regression. It is based on a lab exercise in R from the online course “Statistical Learning” taught by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani form Stanford University. 

## Dataset 
The model is trained and tested with the S&P dataset form 2001 to 2005, which results in an overall 58% accuracy rate.

## Getting Started
In order to run this algorithm, Apache Spark and Hadoop are required. You can either use your own local machine by installing a standalone mode of Spark or using a cloud service such as Databricks.
